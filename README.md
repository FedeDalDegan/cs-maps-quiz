The goal is to celebrate the legacy of one of the most influential games in the history of first-person shooters by offering a space that reflects the passion, nostalgia, and endless fun that Counter-Strike has brought to millions of players worldwide.

## Why I Built This Application
As a long-time fan of Counter-Strike, I wanted to create something that pays homage to the game that has shaped not just my gaming experience, but also that of many others. The competitive spirit, the teamwork, the intense matchesâ€”it's more than just a game, it's a shared experience that unites players from all walks of life. This application is my personal way of contributing to that community and keeping the love for the game alive.
